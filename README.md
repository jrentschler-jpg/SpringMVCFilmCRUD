## Struggles
####Jourdan Rentschler:
Some of the struggles I had faced on this project was the planning process.
I forgot how important it was to sit down and map out how things were going to go.
I started to panic in the beginning to figure out how to connect all the dots and using the ORM and the ERD.
I liked that i was able to work on the .jsp's and playing around with more of the webby stuff.
It also was really cool to work with Aaron after I had created the .jsp's then he would set the Controller to call on that.
Seeing how important the Controller and the DAOImpl is all incorporated was really awesome to see it all come together.
It also really gave us more exposure of the start to finish process of building an application. A lot of moving parts and that previous week we learned a lot of information so I felt a little nervous on this project because I wasn't sure we would have a lot of time. The other thing i struggled with was figuring out who was going to do what... trying to break it down by user story or by front end, back end work.

####David Daniels:
Biggest struggle I had was getting stuck on the update film method in the DAOImpl. Was certainly a learning experience seeing how it was not working correctly and then changing things only to see it still not working correctly. Eventually with some help it was all figured out. Asking for help and communication with others are still not my strengths, both things I hope to get better at. There was a merge conflict at the very end of the project that has caused me to have some fights with git. Hoping to understand this a bit more as we continue to work in groups.


## Lessons Learned
####Jourdan Rentschler:
I learned a lot on COMMUNICATION with our teammates! I think we did a great job of letting each other know who was working in what file so we wouldn't have any merging issues. Learned a lot about the pull and push and how important that is when working in a group. Also, I learned a lot more on how to read exceptions and error messages and where to look in your code to fix those errors. Also, ALWAYS refresh Gradle and your Project!

####David Daniels:
Some lessons learned were that git can be a bit annoying when working with multiple people because of the merge conflicts and such. We did not really run in to too many issues luckily but did have to get used to communicating with everyone on what file we were working in or when we were making pushes.
Learned a lot about how all of the different files work together. How the DAOImpl, Controller, and jsp's all come together was just kind of reinforced on this project. I am still struggling with communicating my ideas that are in my head into words as to explain them to teammates. I can sit down and tinker with things and break them and make them work but communicating it into words is something I need to get better at.
