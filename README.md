## Struggles
Jourdan Rentschler's:
Some of the struggles I had faced on this project was the planning process.
I forgot how important it was to sit down and map out how things were going to go.
I started to panic in the beginning to figure out how to connect all the dots and using the ORM and the ERD.
I liked that i was able to work on the .jsp's and playing around with more of the webby stuff.
It also was really cool to work with Aaron after I had created the .jsp's then he would set the Controller to call on that.
Seeing how important the Controller and the DAOImpl is all incorporated was really awesome to see it all come together.
It also really gave us more exposure of the start to finish process of building an application. A lot of moving parts and that previous week we learned a lot of information so I felt a little nervous on this project because I wasn't sure we would have a lot of time. The other thing i struggled with was figuring out who was going to do what... trying to break it down by user story or by front end, back end work.


## Lessons Learned
Jourdan Rentschler's:
I learned a lot on COMMUNICATION with our teammates! I think we did a great job of letting each other know who was working in what file so we wouldn't have any merging issues. Learned a lot about the pull and push and how important that is when working in a group. Also, I learned a lot more on how to read exceptions and error messages and where to look in your code to fix those errors. Also, ALWAYS refresh Gradle and your Project!
